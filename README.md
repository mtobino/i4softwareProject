# Descripton
The website utilizes the open-source API to grab information about an NBA player and output it in an easy-to-read format. The CSS style file was taken and modified from a previously completed LinkedIn Learning course as personal circumstances and time constraints did not allow proper time for exploration into formatting and CSS in general. The code to parse and format the data is written in JavaScript.
